Thanks for your interest in contributing! There are many ways to contribute to this project. Get started here (link).

A friendly, welcoming voice will go a long way in making people feel excited to contribute to your project. Don’t forget to explain terms or concepts that might be confusing to a newcomer.
Use this as an opportunity to lay the ground rules that will make you happy. The purpose of writing a guide is to make your life easier. It’s okay to say “XYZ pull requests are not accepted” or “I am busy, expect 1-2 weeks to review and merge your PR”. Clarifying your needs up front will make it much faster to review future contributions.
Be concise. Adding too much detail might actually make people less likely to read your guide, which will defeat the purpose.
